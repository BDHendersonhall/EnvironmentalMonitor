# Environmental Monitor
Particle based environmental monitor

## About
This project was created to help me better understand and utilize Particle devices and systems.

The goal is to monitor temperature and humidity in a controlled environment, such as a reptile enclosure (in my case).

### Requirements
Particle device such as an Argon, 3 pin DHT11 temp and humidity sensor.
